Knock7's first game.

Version? No version numbers...

Let me know if you find any bugs or have other suggestions (here on github for now).

Right-click moves all workers. Save is still a bit buggy. Pop-up at the end lets you know when you have played all the current content.

I'm still learning how to organize and run this stuff. Check back later for more info.
